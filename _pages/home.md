Cognitive and/or psychological theories often start as verbal descriptions of observed regularities in human behavior and some intuitive ideas about their causal origins. Such informal verbal theories are a good place to start explanations of cognition, but are also limited. For example, it is difficult to test if an informal theory is internally consistent, if the theory explains observed phenomena, and if the processes assumed by the theory are computationally and physically realizable. To make verbal theories more precise, scientists engage in theoretical modeling.

A theoretical model describes, in a precise (formal) language, how we think that (a part of) cognition or behavior may work. In this workshop, you will learn to build such formal models. Afterwards, you can use the acquired formal modeling skills to develop your own theoretical models in your domain of interest in cognitive science or psychology.

The Theoretical Modeling Workshop is open to interested master's students and PhD candidates. Check out the [full schedule](#schedule) below. Please note that all times for the contact sessions listed below are [CEST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_European_Summer_Time).

The workshop will take place between September 11 and October 30. Physical presence in Nijmegen is not required in order to participate, as all of the contact sessions will be held online.
